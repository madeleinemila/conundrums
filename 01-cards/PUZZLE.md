Twenty random cards are placed in a row, **all face down**.

A move consists of turning a *face down card face up*, and turning over the card *immediately to its right* (this could mean it turns face up or face down - whatever is the opposite of its previous position).

Show that no matter what the choice of cards to turn, this sequence of moves must terminate. That is, no matter what moves you make, eventually **all the cards will end up facing up**.
