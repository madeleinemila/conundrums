## THE SEARCH FOR ARTHUR YORK

The following questions are set on an island in which every inhabitant is either a **knight** or a **knave**. **Knights make only true statements and knaves only false ones**.


### The First Trial

Inspector Craig of Scotland Yard was called to the Island of Knights and Knaves to help find a criminal named Arthur York. What made the process difficult was that it was not known whether Arthur York was a knight or a knave.

One suspect was arrested and brought to trial. Inspector Craig was the presiding judge. Here is a transcript of the trial:

CRAIG: What do you know about Arthur York?

DEFENDANT: Arthur York once claimed that I was a knave.

CRAIG: Are you by any chance Arthur York?

DEFENDANT: Yes.

Is the defendant Arthur York?


### The Second Trial

Another suspect was arrested and brought to trial. Here is a transcript of the trial:

CRAIG: The last suspect was a queer bird; he actually claimed to be Arthur York! Did you ever claim to be Arthur York?

DEFENDANT: No.

CRAIG: Did you ever claim that you are not Arthur York?

DEFENDANT: Yes.

Craig's first guess was that the defendant was not Arthur York, but are there really sufficient grounds for acquitting him?


### The Third Trial

"Don't despair," said Craig to the chief of the island police, "we may find our man yet!"
Well, a third suspect was arrested and brought to trial. He brought with him his defence attorney, and the two made the following statements in court.

DEFENCE ATTORNEY: My client is indeed a knave, but he is not Arthur York.

DEFENDANT: My attorney always tells the truth!

Is there enough evidence either to acquit or convict the defendant?
