1. If the defendant is Arthur York, we get the following contradiction.
<br />
Suppose he is Arthur York. Then he is a knight, since he claimed to be Arthur York. That would mean that his first answer to Craig was also true, which means that he, Arthur York, once claimed that he was a knave. But that is impossible!
<br />
Therefore the defendant is not Arthur York, although he is, of course, a knave.


2. The defendant is either a knight or a knave. Suppose he is a knight. Then his answers were both truthful; in particular, his second answer was truthful, so he did once claim that he is not Arthur York. His claim was true, since he is a knight; thus he is not Arthur York. This proves that if he is a knight, then he is not Arthur York.

Suppose he is a knave. Then his answers were both lies; in particular, his first answer was a lie, which means that he did once claim to be Arthur York. But since he is a knave, he lied when he claimed to be Arthur York, hence he is not Arthur York. And so we have proved that if he is a knave, then he is not Arthur York.

We now see that regardless of whether he is a knight or a knave, he cannot be Arthur York. And so he was acquitted. Incidentally, it cannot be determined whether he is a knight or a knave.


3. It was very stupid for the defendant to say what he did! Of all the false statements he could have made, he chose just about the most incriminating one possible.

Here is why the defendant must be Arthur York:

Suppose the defense attorney is a knight. Then his statement is true, which implies that the defendant is a knave. Hence the defendant's statement is false, which means that the defense attorney is a knave. So if the defense attorney is a knight, he is also a knave, which is impossible.

Therefore the defense attorney can't be a knight; he must be a knave. It then follows that the defendant is also a knave, since he falsely claimed that his attorney always tells the truth. And so we now know that both the attorney and the defendant are knaves.

Now, if the defendant were not Arthur York, then it would be true that the defendant is a knave but not Arthur York, hence the attorney would have made a true statement. But the attorney is a knave and can't make a true statement! Therefore the defendant must be Arthur York.
