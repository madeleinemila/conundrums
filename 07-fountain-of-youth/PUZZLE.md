## IN SEARCH OF THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH

We are back on the Island of Knights and Knaves (where **knights make only true statements and knaves only false ones**). Reynolds arrived without mishap, and his adventures began.

1. A Preliminary Incident:

On the first day, Reynolds met a native who made a statement. Reynolds then realized that if the native was a knight, the Fountain of Youth must be on the island, but if the native was a knave, there was no way of telling whether or not the Fountain of Youth was on the island...

What statement could the native have made?


2. A Grand Metapuzzle:

Reynolds's next adventure was far more interesting - it involves as profound a logic puzzle as any I have ever come across.

On the following day, Reynolds came across two natives A and B and said to them, "Please tell me whatever you know about the Fountain of Youth. Is it on this island?".

The two natives then made the following statements:

A: If B is a knave, then the Fountain of Youth is on this island.

B: I never claimed that the Fountain of Youth is not on this island!

Reynolds thought about this for a bit and said, "Please, now, I want a definite answer! Is the Fountain of Youth on this island?". One of the two answered - he either said yes or he said no - and Reynolds then knew whether or not the Fountain of Youth was on the island.

Some months later, Reynolds told the above facts to Inspector Craig (he was a good friend of Craig's and knew of his fondness for logic puzzles). Craig said, "It is obviously impossible for me to deduce from the facts you have given me whether or not the Fountain of Youth is on this island. You haven't told me whether A or B was the one who answered your second question, or what answer he gave. Whichever one it was who answered, suppose the other one had answered instead. Do you know if you could then have decided whether or not the fountain is on the island?"

Reynolds thought about this, and finally told Craig whether or not he knew whether he could have decided had the other one answered the second question instead.

"Thank you," said Craig. "I now know whether or not the Fountain of Youth is on the island."

Is the Fountain of Youth on the island?
