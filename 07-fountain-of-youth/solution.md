## Part 1

One possibility is that the native said: "I am a knight and the Fountain of Youth is on this island." If he was a knight, then the fountain is obviously on the island. If he was not a knight, then what he said is false, regardless of whether or not the fountain is on the island, and there would be no way of telling whether or not the fountain was there.


## Part 2

B said that he had never claimed that the Fountain of Youth was not on the island. If B is a knave, then B has previously claimed that the Fountain of Youth is not on the island, and since he is a knave, the fountain is on the island! So we now know that if B is a knave, the Fountain of Youth is on the island. Well, this is just what A said; therefore A must be a knight.


And so we now know the following two facts:


Fact 1: A is a knight.


Fact 2: If B is a knave, the Fountain of Youth is on the island.


Of course Reynolds, who can reason as well as you and I, realized these two facts also.


Now, we are not told who answered Reynolds's second question, or whether the answer was yes or no, and so there are four possible cases that we must analyze.


Case A1: A claimed that the fountain was on the island (by answering yes).
In this case, Reynolds, knowing that A is a knight, would know that the fountain was on the island.


Case A2: A claimed that the fountain was not on the island (by answering no).
In this case, Reynolds would have known that the fountain was not on the island.


Case B1: B claimed that the fountain was on the island (by answering yes).
In this case, Reynolds would know that the fountain was on the island by reasoning as follows:
"Suppose the fountain is not on the island. Then B is a knave for having just affirmed that it is. But by Fact 2, if B is a knave, the fountain is on the island. This is a contradiction, hence the fountain must be on the island after all (and also B must be a knight)."


Case B2: B claimed that the fountain was not on the island (by answering no).
In this case, Reynolds could not possibly know whether or not the fountain was on the island; B could be a knave who falsely claimed that the fountain was not on the island and who also falsely claimed that he never claimed that the fountain was not on the island, or he could be a knight who truthfully claimed that the fountain was on the island and who also claimed that the fountain was not on the island. And so in this case, Reynolds couldn't decide.


However, we are given that Reynolds did decide, and therefore Case B2 is ruled out. So we now know that one of three cases - A1, A2, B1 - is the one that holds, and we can henceforth forget about the fourth case B2.


At this point, we must take into account the second part of the story - the conversation Reynolds had with Inspector Craig. It is important to realize that Craig did not ask Reynolds whether, if the other one had answered the question, Reynolds could have decided; Craig asked Reynolds whether he knew whether or not he could have decided. Let us see how Reynolds would reason in response to Craig's question. Of course ReynoIds knows which of the three cases - A1, A2, B1 - is the actual one, although we don't (at least not yet), and so we must see how Reynolds would reason in each of the three cases.


Case A1: Reynolds would reason thus-


"A is a knight; A said that the fountain is on the island; the fountain is on the island. Now suppose B had answered my second question. I don't know whether he would have answered yes or no.


"Suppose he had answered yes. Then I would have known that the fountain was on the island, because I would have reasoned that if the fountain were not on the island then B is a knave for claiming it was. But I also know (Fact 2) that if B is a knave, the fountain is on the island and so I would have gotten a contradiction from the assumption that the fountain is not on the island. Therefore, if B had answered yes, I would have known that the fountain was on the island.


"But suppose he had answered no? Then I would have had no way of knowing whether or not the fountain was on the island; I would have reasoned that he could be a knight and the fountain was not on the island, or he could be a knave and the fountain was on the island. And so if he had answered no, then I couldn't have decided whether or not the fountain was on the island.


"In summary, had B answered yes, I could have decided; had he answered no, I couldn't have decided. Since I have no way of knowing what answer B would have given, I have no way of knowing whether I could have decided or not."


Case A2: In this case, here is how Reynolds would reason -


"The fountain is not on this island; A told me this and A is a knight. Now, suppose B had answered instead. Well, B is a knight, because I have already proved that if B were a knave, then the fountain would be on this island, which it isn't. Since B is a knight, then had he been the one to answer, he would also have answered no. But then I couldn't have known that he was a knight, and so I would have had no way ofknowing whether the fountain is on the island or not. In brief, had Bbeen the one to answer, then I definitely could not have decided whether or not the fountain was on the island."


Case B1: This is the simplest case of all! In this case, B is the one who really answered, hence Reynolds would already know that if A had been the one to answer, he could have decided about the fountain, because he already knew that A was a knight.


We now see that if Case A1 were the actual one, then Reynolds could not know whether he could have decided, hence his answer to Craig would be: "No, I don't know whether I could have decided had the other one been the one who answered my second question."


If Case A2 is the actual one, then Reynolds would have told Craig: "Yes; I do know whether or not I could have decided." Reynolds, in fact, even knows that he couldn't have decided.


If Case B1 is the actual one, then Reynolds would again have told Craig: "Yes, I know whether or not I could have decided." He in fact even knows that he could have decided.


Therefore, if Reynolds answered yes to Craig's question, then either Case A2 or Case B1 holds, but there is no way we or Craig could tell which, hence Craig couldn't have known whether or not the Fountain of Youth was on the island. But we are given that Craig did know, hence Reynolds must have answered no and Craig then knew that Case A1 was the only possibility and that **the fountain was on the island**.
