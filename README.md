# Conundrums

An archive of pseudo-weekly puzzles to keep the corners of our brains sharp.

Logic puzzles, algorithm exposure and programmatic thinking.

Answers could take any form.
No code required, although you could code it out if that's what you felt.

General vibe was:

MONDAY(ish)

A new puzzle was posted (in its own directory).



THROUGHOUT THE WEEK

You could think about answers, or not. This repo is there for you when you have downtime.
If you want to hear from the person that set the puzzle, and find out if youâ€™re on the right track, either:

- submit a pull request

- just push and let the person know



SUNDAY(ish)

Answers were posted.



And yeah, you could Google the answers, but where's the fun in that.
