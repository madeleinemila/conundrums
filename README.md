# Conundrums

Pseudo-weekly puzzles to keep the corners of our brains sharp.

Logic puzzles, algorithm exposure and programmatic thinking.

Answers can take any form.
No code required, although feel free to code it out if that's what you feel.

We're thinking a starting point could be that if you have an answer, submit a pull request and the person that posted the puzzle can give feedback, sort of like the homework repo? Might work, might not, we'll see how it plays out this first round?


And yeah, you could Google the answers, but where's the fun in that.
