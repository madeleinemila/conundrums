# Conundrums

Pseudo-weekly puzzles to keep the corners of our brains sharp.

Logic puzzles, algorithm exposure and programmatic thinking.

______________

Answers can take any form.
No code required, although feel free to code it out if that's what you feel.

General vibe so far:

MONDAY

A new puzzle is posted (in its own directory).



THROUGHOUT THE WEEK

You can think about answers, or not. This repo is there for you when you have downtime.
If you want to hear from the person that set the puzzle, and find out if youâ€™re on the right track, either:

- submit a pull request

- just push and let the person know



SUNDAY

Answers are posted.



And yeah, you could Google the answers, but where's the fun in that.
